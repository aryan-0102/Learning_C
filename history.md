## History of C Programming Language

The C programming language, created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs between 1969 and 1973, was initially designed for developing the UNIX operating system. Derived from the B programming language, C quickly gained popularity due to its portability and power.

**1978:** Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published "The C Programming Language," which became a seminal book on C.

**1983:** ANSI formed a committee to standardize C, resulting in ANSI C (C89). This standardization boosted its adoption and portability.

**1990s:** C's popularity soared with compilers available for various platforms, making it a go-to choice for software development.

**1999:** ISO introduced the C99 standard, bringing new features like variable-length arrays and improved comments.

**2011:** C11 followed, adding features like multi-threading support and type generics.

**Present:** C remains vital, particularly in systems programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.
