# `STRUCTURE`
A structure is a user-defined data type that allows you to group together variables of different data types under a single name. Structures provide a way to represent a collection of related information. The syntax for defining a structure is as follows:<b>
SYNTAX : 
```
struct structure_name {
    data_type member1;
    data_type member2;
    // Additional members as needed
};
```
Structures allow you to organize related data in a meaningful way, making it easier to manage and manipulate complex data structures in your programs. Additionally, you can use structures to create arrays, linked lists, and other more advanced data structures in C.
