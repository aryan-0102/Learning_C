# LOOPS
Loops are essential for tasks that require repetitive execution of a certain block of code, such as iterating over elements of an array, processing user input, or implementing various algorithms. They provide a way to make programs more dynamic and efficient.

## While
The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true. Thus it is a pre-test loop

```
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed while the condition is true
}
```
## For
The for loop provides a concise way to iterate over a range of values. It consists of an initialization, a condition, and an update expression.
```
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed while the condition is true
}
```
## Do-While
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it always executes the block of code at least once because it evaluates the condition after the code block. This is a post-test loop .
```
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);
```
