># Data Types
 ## `Prebuilt(Primary)`
* ### INT 
  Integer data type stores values like 1,22,456, etc. <br>
  It occupies 4 bytes and has a range of -32767 to 32767. <br>
  Syntax: int variable_name ;
* ### CHAR
  Character data type is used to store a single alphabet .<br>
  It is stored in single quotes and takes 1 byte with a range of -127 to 127 <br>
* ### FLOAT
  It stores values with up to 6 places after decimal.
  These require 4 bytes to store.
* ### DOUBLE
  It also stores values with up to 10 digits after decimal.<br>
  It takes 8 bytes to store.


  
 ## `Prebuilt (Derived)`
 * ### Array
   Array is a data type that can store multiple values under a single variable name .
   They can store any of the primary data types, but only one type per variable.
   * ### Strings
   Strings are arrays that can store only characters and contain a null character at the end representing the end of a string.

----
 
 ## `User-defined (Also Derived)`
  * ### Structure
    The struct keyword is used to define a structure, a user-defined data type that allows bundling different types of data together.
Each member of the structure can have a different data type.
 * ### Union
   A union in C is a user-defined data type that allows you to store different data types in the same memory location. The memory allocated for a union is determined by the size of its largest member. This means that all members of a union share the same memory space.
 *  ### TYPEDEF
   The typedef keyword is used to create a new name for an existing data type or a user-defined data type.
It's often used to simplify complex declarations or to create aliases for data types.

### If you're new to programming, it's normal to feel overwhelmed at first. However, to help you get started, let's focus on primary data types. By doing so, you'll gain a strong foundation that will undoubtedly make more complex data types easier to handle in the future. Below's a simple diagram to make it easier.
