# Introduction
C can be considered a mid-level language that is closer to the hardware that most of the other popular languages like java, C++,python,etc.
Introduced to the world in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie it still hold it ground among the fairly newer languages and still remains the preferance for applications like developing Operating Systems , kernels , embedded systems and many more .

## Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of ordered steps designed to perform a specific task providing a specific outcome .
For example, preparing a cup of coffee starts with a pan on the stove with some water and milk . Later adding some coffee beans with sugar and after  a while you get the output ,the elixir for the mind.

Our life is full of such tiny algorithms and depends on them to function and in the computer world, it serves as the roadmap for the machine performing duly task for its user.

## Flowcharts 

These are the graphical representation of the above mentioned algorithms , providing a visual gateway into the computer world with the help of some containers ( of specific shapes ) and some good old lines .
