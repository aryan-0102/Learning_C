# Conditional Statements
In C, conditional statements allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. The primary conditional statements in C are switch,if, else if, and else. 

## If-Else if
SYNTAX :
if (condition1) {
    // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if all conditions are false
}

## Switch

Syntax : switch (expression) {
    case constant1:
        // code to be executed if expression matches constant1
        break;
    case constant2:
        // code to be executed if expression matches constant2
        break;
    // more cases as needed
    default:
        // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any constant
}
