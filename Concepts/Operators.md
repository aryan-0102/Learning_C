># Operators #

C programming language supports a variety of operators that perform different operations on variables and values. Here's an overview of some common types of operators in C:


>### * <b>Arithmetic Operators:</b><br>
Addition (+): Adds two operands.<br>
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.<br>
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.<br>
Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand.<br>
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand.


> ### *<b> Relational Operators:</b>
<br>Equal to (==): Checks if two operands are equal.<br>
<br>Not equal to (!=): Checks if two operands are not equal.
<br>Greater than (>): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
<br>Less than (<): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
<br>Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
<br>Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.


> ### * <b> Logical Operators:</b>
<br>Logical AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.
<br>Logical OR (||): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
<br>Logical NOT (!): Returns true if the operand is false, and vice versa.


> ### * <b>Assignment Operators:</b>
<br>Assignment (=): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
<br>Addition assignment (+=): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
<br>Subtraction assignment (-=): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
<br>Multiplication assignment (*=): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
<br>Division assignment (/=): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
<br>Modulus assignment (%=): Calculates the modulus of the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.


>### * <b>Increment and Decrement Operators:</b>
<br>Increment (++): Increases the value of the operand by 1.
<br>Decrement (--): Decreases the value of the operand by 1.


>### * <b>Bitwise Operators:</b>
<br>Bitwise AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation.
<br>Bitwise OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation.
<br>Bitwise XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation.
<br>Bitwise NOT (~): Inverts the bits of the operand.
<br>Left shift (<<): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by a specified number of positions.
<br>Right shift (>>): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by a specified number of positions.


>### * <b>Conditional Operator (Ternary Operator):</b>
Conditional (? :): Evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false.
